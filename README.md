wk4 Friday Independent Project using ASP.Net Core API

## Personal site requires the following minimum pages:
1. A styled landing page.
2. An about page that helps describe your journey to become a junior developer.
3. A projects page which uses the GitHub API to display your three most-starred repositories.

## The next step.

You've learned a lot in the ASP.NET course, and have the ability to include as much functionality into this page as you'd like. Consider adding a guestbook for visitors to sign, or a suggestion box for future projects.
